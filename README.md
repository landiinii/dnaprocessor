# dnaprocessor

/*

A processor application that can take lines or files of DNA nucleotide sequences and modify or change them according to the users desired result. Functions that it can currently handle include reversing the sequence, transcribing the DNA to RNA, and translating the RNA into amino acid sequences.

Program is implemented and operated through a linux command line. 

  A command argunment declaring what type of input (either read from a file or typed into the bash) is required to be passed when running
  the executable.
        Examples: ./dna file (will pull DNA sequence input from the file DNAinput.txt) ./dna type (will allow the user to directly type 
        the DNA sequence they wish to modify).
        
  The text file DNAinput.txt can be modified to take in the Sequence the user wishes.
   
  All other commands are user friendly and very self descriptive within the interface of the program and their implemantaion can be best 
  understood through a trial run of the existing prgram.
